I taught this course at **Texas A&M University** as a *Graduate Assistant Lecturer (instructor of record)* for the following semesters: Spring 2021 (194 students), Summer 2021 (48 students), Fall 2022 (36 students), and Summer 2022 (116). I have also served as a *Graduate Teaching Assistant* for the Spring 2023 (300) semester.

In this course, students are introduced to the vast and dynamic ocean environment. The curriculum covers the interrelated subdisciplines of ocean sciences, including physical, chemical, biological, and geological oceanography. Students explore the oceans' importance to humanity, examining topics such as marine resources, climate regulation, and biodiversity. The course also addresses significant human impacts on the oceans, discussing issues like pollution, overfishing, and climate change.

I primarily cover geological-related topics, while materials related to biological oceanography are covered by my TA mentor, [Dr. Jason Sylvan](https://artsci.tamu.edu/oceanography/contact/profiles/jason-sylvan.html).
