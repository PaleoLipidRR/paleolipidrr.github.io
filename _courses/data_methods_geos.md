        I taught this course at <strong>Texas A&M University</strong> as a <em>Graduate Teaching Assistant</em> for the MATLAB programming lab for the Spring 2023 semester (30) semester. The lecture portion of the course is taught by <a href="https://artsci.tamu.edu/oceanography/contact/profiles/henry-potter.html" target="_blank">Dr. Henry Potter</a>.

        <br>
        In this course, students gain hands-on experience working with various types of geoscience data using MATLAB as the primary tool. The curriculum covers fundamental statistical tools, including the concepts of probability and probability distributions, linear regressions, one-way and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

        Course materials largely refer to the textbook "A Primer of Ecological Statistics"
