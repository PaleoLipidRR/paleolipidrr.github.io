Welcome to my personal website!

I am Ronnakrit Rattanasriampaipong, but you may know me by many other names! "Ronnie" is what I normally go by in English-speaking conversations. I am currently a <a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc">NOAA Climate & Global Change Postdoctoral Fellow</a> (<a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc/class-33">Class 33</a>) at the Department of Geosciences at the University of Arizona in Tucson, AZ, working on the project <em>"TEXAS: Towards a full proxy system modeling of TetraEther indeX of Ammonia oxidizerS and reanalysis of temperature trends for the past 100 million years"</em> with Dr. Jessica Tierney as my mentor.

In Fall 2023, I earned my doctoral degree in Oceanography from the <a href="https://ocean.tamu.edu/">Department of Oceanographyat Texas A&amp;M University</a> in College Station, TX. I have spent five years and one semeseter working in the with Paleoceanography and Organic Geochemistry Lab under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JHoI_8wAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Yige Zhang</a>. My dissertation research focuses on leveraging the use of lipid biomarkers, specifically Glycerol Dialkyl Glycerol Tetraethers (GDGTs) â€” membrane-spanning lipids of ancient marine microbes, beyond their typical SST reconstruction application (commonly known as TEX<sub>86</sub> paleotemperature proxy). One of my dissertation chapters has published in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2123193119"><i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</i></a> in 2022, demonstrating that GDGT compositions recorded in marine sedimentary archives likely reflect ecological shifts of source organisms over geological history. The findings holds a crucial implication TEX<sub>86</sub> proxy, one of a few geochemical proxies that can provide reliable ocean temperature reconstructions over the past 100 million years.

I am a proud <a href="https://www.fulbrightthai.org/grants-for-thais/thai-graduate-scholarship-program-tgs">Thai Fulbrighter</a>, a vivid amateur <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/m_results_participant.aspx?fname=Ronnakrit&lname=Rattanasriampaipong#">long-distance runner</a>, a passionate self-taught pythonista, and a data visualization geek.
