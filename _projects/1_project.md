In this project, we leverage previously published archaeal membrane lipids, known as Glycerol Dialkyl Glycerol Tetrathers (GDGTs), derived from multiple archives, including laboratory cultures of both marine and hot springs archaea, modern marine waters and sediments, as well as ancient marine sediments dated back up to 192 million years ago.
